# Double Kappa Mu Shadowed Distribution
This is a code package related to the follow scientific article: 

N. Mensi, D. B. Rawat and E. Balti, "[PLS for V2I Communications Using Friendly Jammer and Double kappa-mu Shadowed Fading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08827)," 2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)

The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that reproduces the analytical and Monte Carlo simulations of Double Kappa-Mu Shadowed distribution.

# Content of Code Package
This package contains 2 files:

1- "DoubleKappaMuShadowedCDF.m" returns the analytical expression of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Double Kappa-Mu Shadowed distribution.

2- "main.m" validates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) by comparing the analytical and Monte Carlo simulations.

See each file for further documentation.
